As an individual reaching the age where housing will be an upcoming concern of mine, I decided to look into the factors that influence the resale price of a flat and train different models to be able to predict the resale price of a flat based on the factors and historical prices of previous sales. Unlike items such as laptops and clothes, the housing prices are heavily influenced by the marketâ€™s demand and other factors which makes the price range of housing flats very huge. Therefore, by creating the model to estimate the price of the house based on the factors, it will help me and hopefully others in their future purchases of their homes.
